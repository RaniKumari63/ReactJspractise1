            <p>A History of British Fishes is a natural history book by William Yarrell, serialised in 19 parts from 1835, and then published bound in two volumes in 1836. It is a handbook describing every type of fish then known to occur in the British Isles. Yarrell was a London bookseller and newsagent with the time and income to indulge his interest in natural history. He was a prominent member of several natural history societies, had an extensive library and collection of specimens, and a wide network of naturalist friends who helped him garner material for his writings, notably his book on fishes and the 1843 A History of British Birds. He followed Thomas Bewick's example with up-to-date data, accurate illustrations, and detailed descriptions. The woodcut illustrations were drawn by Alexander Fussell, engraved by John Thompson, and published by John Van Voorst. Yarrell died in 1856; the third edition was produced posthumously.</p>
